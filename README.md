## Why *'almost'*?
I was told several times that my version of minesweeper does not correspond to the rules of the original, I found out that
the following rule differences can be found: 

- if a flag is placed incorrectly, you loose
- if a flag is placed correctly, tiles get revealed

I personally prefer this rule change (and I am lazy), therefore the rules remain unchanged

**Controls**

|input|action|
|---|---|
|[leftMouse]|reveal tile|
|[rightMouse]|set flag/remove flag|
|[TAB]|restart|
